  <p>Pasta doesn't have to be crazy fancy, though the one below is. </p>
  <p>The image below is of a Michilin Star winning pasta dish. </p>

  <p>Looks good, right?</p>
  <p>Well, I contend that pasta can taste great without any Michelin stars.</p>
  <p>Where pasta is concerned, simple tastes the best.</p> 
  <p>In fact, there's scientific proof backing this up</p>

  <p>My baby prefers his pasta simple, and so will you.</p>
  <p>That's good enough science, right?</p>

<h2>
  <p>WHAT YOU NEED</p>
  <p>You will need some of the following to make great pasta:</p>

</h2>
<h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pasta: can be any type, long, short, curly, whatever </li>
  <li>Tomato sauce, if you want a marinara style sauce. </li>
  <li>Fresh tomatoes, if you have them. Excellent in red sauces or in creamy pastas when added at the end of the cooking process </li>
  <li>Some fat, preferably olive oil or butter </li>
  <li>Fresh vegetables like onions or shallots, garlic, carrots   </li>
  <li>Frozen veggies are fine too. Include frozen peas and corn, diced carrots, lima beans, it's all good. </li>
  <li>Fresh herbs if you have them, but who are we kidding. This is weeknight pasta. <br> 
Dried are great too: 
<br> basil, thyme, oregano </li>
  <li>Spices like black pepper, smoked paprika, curry powder, cayenne </li> 
  <li>Sauces like sriracha and soy sauce can enhance flavor. Be careful not to overuse </li> 
  <li>Salt </li>
  <li>Sugar </li>

</ul>

  <p> You don't need everything on this list. Not by far. Simple is best right?</p>
  <p> Instead, imagine how you want your pasta to be. Veggie-filled marinara? Creamy fettucine? It's your choice. </p>
  <p> See below for step by step instructions on how to cook world-class tasting pasta in 20 minutes or less, on a week night.</p>

  <p>WHAT YOU DO</p>

<p> For the sauce </p>

<ol>
  <li>Begin boiling water </li>
  <li>Chop whatever veggies you've decided to use, starting with onions </li>
  <li>Turn on pan, bring to medium heat before adding any fat </li>  
  <li>Begin to sautee onions on medium heat in butter and/or olive oil </li>
  <li>Add chopped garlic once onions begin to become transluscent </li>
  <li>Add any other veggies to your sautee pan </li>
  <li>Incorporate fresh tomatoes, if using, after veggies have had a chance to sputter and fry a little. The browner they are, the more delicious caramel notes you'll enjoy in your sauce </li>
  <li>Incorporate tomato sauce/canned tomatoes, if using </li>
  <li>Once veggies are beginning to become tender (and a little bite to them is nice!), take a spoonful of sauce and let it cool to taste it </li>
  <li>Assess flavor, adjust saltiness, add sugar in tiny increments if necessary, adjust heat and spiciness </li>
  <li>Let simmer for 5 minutes before taking off heat. This isn't your grandma's bolognese that needs 15 hours cook time </li>
  <li>Finish with butter or cream if desired. Adding cream to very warm tomato based sauces may lead to curdling </li>
  <li>Set aside until pasta is done </li>



  <p>For the pasta, which you should do once the veggies in your sauce have already started sauteeing and will be tender soon. </p>
<ol>

  <li>Bring water the a boil. Salt it.  </li>
  <li>Place pasta in the water, gently to avoid splashes. </li>
  <li>Pro Tip: set a timer </li>
  <li>Taste it when timer goes off. You might like it "al dente," which means with bite, or chewy </li>
  <li>Drain pasta in collander or with lid of pot </li>
  <li>Place pasta back in the pot you used for boiling,  </li>
  <li>Add butter or olive oil (preferably butter) to the cooked pasta, stir to incorporate </li>
  <li>Mix desired amount of pasta with desired amount of sauce </li>
  <li>ENJOY! You've just made delicious weeknight pasta, like a boss. </li>
  <li> </li>
</ol>
